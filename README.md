## What

Find short & sweet single word domain hacks with Hipster Domains at
[Hipster.Domains][hd]. All domains listed should be available for
registration.  Originally created by [Bram Hoskin](https://github.com/bramgg/), now (somewhat) maintained by [Daniel Haaser](https://github.com/danielhaaser).

## Development

### General

Requirements for Hipster Domains are Python 3 and MongoDB. Environment management is handled with [virtualenv][virtualenv]. 

### Installation

1. Install Python 3. This can be done with [Homebrew][homebrew] on OSX or `apt-get` on Ubuntu.
2. Install pip3. This is the Python 3 version of the Python package manager. You can use [Homebrew][homebrew] on OSX or `apt-get` on Ubuntu.
3. Install virtualenv with `pip3 install virtualenv`.
4. Create a virtual environment within the project directory. Navigate to the project directory, and execute `virtualenv -p python3 venv`. This will create a virtual environment named *venv*, configured to use Python 3.
5. Activate the virtual environment by running `source venv/bin/activate`.
6. Install the project dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
7. [Install MongoDB][mongo_install] and activate it with `mongod`.


Hipster Domains is ready to be used locally. Just run
[populate_db.py][populate_db] to populate the database with 100 domain hacks.
Note this is for testing purposes only and the domains will be marked as
available without any verification. In production use [update.py][update] as
described below.

### Domains

[update.py][update] calculates all possible domain hacks from words in
[words.txt][words] and inserts/updates their availability with [Domainr's
API][domainr] (API key must be set in [environment.ini][environment]). [update.py][update] uses [schedule][schedule] to check domain availability every 24 hours.

[words.txt][words] is supposedly the 50,000 most common english words on the
internet, though I can't remember where I got it. Adding or changing words is as
simple as changing [words.txt][words].

### Website

Hipster Domains' official website is intentionally very simple inside and out.
[website.py][website] handles routing and serving dynamic/static content. HTML
is in [views][views] and CSS is in [static][static].
